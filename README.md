# Automating Infrastructure Using Bash Script

In some situations we need to create directory structures, add users and permissions on several machines. However, doing this manually can be a lot of work. For this, we use a bash script to create the following structure:

## Directories and Permissions
* /public (777)
* /adm (770)
* /ven (770)
* /sec (770)

## Groups
* GRP_ADM
* GRP_VEN
* GRP_SEC

## Users
* Carlos
* Maria
* Joao
* Deborah
* Sebastiana
* Roberto
* Josefina
* Amanda
* Rogerio
